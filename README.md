challenge game for assignment 4

Welcome to the TMNT Battle Royale. You may choose to be either the good guy defending the city or the bad guy set out for destruction. To start the game, select a character from either team. Each time the attack button is pressed, your character's attack points reduces first opponent one's health. Then after opponent one is defeated, your attack reduces the second opponent's health. Each time you attack, your attack value is increased by the base attack value. Your opponents are randomly selected once you choose a character. To start a new game, press 'Start New Game' and select a new character or continue playing with the previous character.
